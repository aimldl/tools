# How to Install Nomacs, an Image Viewer Program
## What is Nomacs?
Nomacs is a popular image viewer program for Linux. 

```
Ubuntu's Basic Image Viewer < Nomacs < Gimp
```

It has more functionalities than Ubuntu's basic image viewer, but it's not as complex or heavy as Gimp, Linux alternative to Adobe Photoshop. Nomacs is light-weight, but provides useful functions to edit images. Format conversion, resize the resolution, rotation, crop, and so on. It also supports a command-line command `nomacs` which can be powerful when it's used right.

For details, refer to the following links.

```

## Snapshot
This is a snapshot of Nomacs after opening multiple image files. The option is `Panels > Thumbnail Preview (Shift+T)`. I was able to feel the productivity boost compared to the basic image viewer.
