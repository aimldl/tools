Need help managing your time?

PomodoroÂ® is a technique to help you focus on a task, by working hard for short intervals then taking a break.

Toggl Button's pomodoro mode lets you set your interval length, and reminds you to take a break when time's up. You can also enable a ticking sound to help keep you on track.

Turn it on from the Pomodoro page.
