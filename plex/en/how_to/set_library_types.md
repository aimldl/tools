# Setting the library types
 Libraries currently have one of five types:
 
1. Movies — Feature movies like “Gone with the Wind (1939)”
2. TV Shows — “Dexter”, “Days of our Lives”, etc.
3. Music — Your music collection
4. Photos — Images from your hard drive or applications like Aperture and iPhoto.
5. Other Videos — Videos you’ve made at home or noncommercial material that has never been broadcast (e.g., media not appearing in online databases). You can also use this type for obscure content or arbitrary video files, clips, etc. Items in Home Videos Libraries will not download artwork or other metadata from internet sources.
