# Setting the library types
Check that your media collection has been named and organized in a way that Plex will understand. If not, you may notice content isn’t recognized, is mis-matched, or not found at all.

## Library types
Libraries currently have one of five types:
 
1. Movies — Feature movies like “Gone with the Wind (1939)”
2. TV Shows — “Dexter”, “Days of our Lives”, etc.
3. Music — Your music collection
4. Photos — Images from your hard drive or applications like Aperture and iPhoto.
5. Other Videos — Videos you’ve made at home or noncommercial material that has never been broadcast (e.g., media not appearing in online databases). You can also use this type for obscure content or arbitrary video files, clips, etc. Items in Home Videos Libraries will not download artwork or other metadata from internet sources.

## Media file name convention
- Movies are gathered together in a “Movies” type folder, TV Shows in a “TV Shows” type folder, etc.
- Movies are named as follows:
  ```text
  [Movie_Name (Release_Year)]
  e.g., Avatar (2009).mp4
  ```
* TV Show episodes are named with the season and episode:
```
[Show Name SxxEyy]
e.g., Dexter s01e01.mp4
```
* TV Show episodes are stored in their own folder as follows:
```
/TV Shows/Show Name/Season/episodes
e.g., /TV Shows/Dexter/Season 01/Dexter s01e01.mp4
```
