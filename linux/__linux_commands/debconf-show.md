# debconf-show

## Problem

To install Java, the terms and conditions must be agreed which can be automated by `deb-conf-set-selections`. The problem is I don't know what variables should be used.

## Hint

Google search: debconf-set-selections

[How to find out the variable names for debconf-set-selections?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/457388/how-to-find-out-the-variable-names-for-debconf-set-selections)

> Q: Let's say I want to install `mysql` from a script without being asked any configuration questions like what root password I want to set by `apt`. I would then preset the `debconf` variables:

> echo mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server/root_password password xyzzy | debconf-set-selections
> echo mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server/root_password_again password xyzzy | debconf-set-selections

> ```bash
> $ sudo debconf-show mysql-server-5.7
> * mysql-server/root_password: (password omitted)
> * mysql-server/root_password_again: (password omitted)
>   mysql-server-5.7/start_on_boot: true
>   mysql-server/no_upgrade_when_using_ndb:
>   mysql-server/password_mismatch:
>   mysql-server-5.7/really_downgrade: false
>   mysql-server-5.7/nis_warning:
>   mysql-server-5.7/postrm_remove_databases: false
>   mysql-server-5.7/installation_freeze_mode_active:
> ```

> ```bash
> # debconf-show --listowners | grep mysql | xargs debconf-show
> * mysql-server/root_password: (password omitted)
> * mysql-server/root_password_again: (password omitted)
>   mysql-server-5.7/postrm_remove_databases: false
>   mysql-server-5.7/nis_warning:
>   mysql-server-5.7/installation_freeze_mode_active:
>   mysql-server/password_mismatch:
>   mysql-server-5.7/start_on_boot: true
>   mysql-server/no_upgrade_when_using_ndb:
>   mysql-server-5.7/really_downgrade: false
> #

## Solution

```bash
$ sudo debconf-show oracle-java14-installer
  shared/error-oracle-license-v1-2:
  oracle-java14-installer/local:
* shared/present-oracle-license-v1-2:
  oracle-java14-installer/not_exist:
* shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-2: true
$
```
