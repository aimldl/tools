# Pinta

is very unstable.

## Google search: how to install pinta in ubuntu 18.04

* [How to install Pinta on Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04](https://www.programsbuzz.com/article/how-install-pinta-ubuntu-1804-and-1604)

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y pinta
```

* Uninstalled after trying out the first image

```bash
$ sudo apt purge -y pinta
```

## Why I gave up on Pinta?

 The program crashed when I 

* tried to resize an image,
* reopened it and crop the image, and
* reopened it and rescale the image.

This is my first experience with Pinta. So I gave up on Pinta.
