#### How to Create a Sub-Directory with a Web Browser
Click "New file" and type in "directory_name/file_name". A new file is created along with the specified directory. For details, refer to [How do I create a folder in a GitHub repository?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository/47748184#47748184)
> You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. On github you can do it this way:

1. go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
2. click on New file
3. on the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create
4. then type /. This creates a folder
5. you can add more folders similarly
6. finally, give the new file a name
7. finally click Commit new file.

#### How to Upload an Entire Directory with a Web Browser
To upload an entire directory with a web browser, click "Upload files", select the files in the directory, and commit to Github.

> 1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
> 2. Under your repository name, click Upload files. 
> 3. Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree. 
> 4. Type a commit message that describes the change you made to the file. 
> 5. Decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[Creating a new pull request.](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)" 
> 6. Click Commit changes.
