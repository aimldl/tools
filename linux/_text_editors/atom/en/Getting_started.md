## Setting Up Atom as a Markdown Editor
Atom can be configured as a Markdown Editor with convenient functionalities. Several recommended packages are:
* language-markdown
* markdown-writer
* markdown-preview-enhanced
* markdown-folding

Especially, the markdown preview boosts productivity in my case. What is typed in on the left is previewed immediately on the right.
