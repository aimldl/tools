## Installing Spyder
Spyder is installed when Anaconda is installed by default. To install Spyder alone on Ubuntu Linux, you may use apt-get. For other methods, 
refer to [Installation](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html), Spyder Docs.

### Installing with Anaconda (recommended)
> Spyder is included by default in the Anaconda Python distribution, which comes with everything you need to get started in an all-in-one package. This is the easiest way to install Spyder for any of our supported platforms.

### Installing with an alternative distribution
#### Install on GNU/LinuxÂ¶
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install spyder3
```

## Updating Spyder
If Spyder is installed with Anaconda, update Anaconda along with Spyder.
```bash
$ conda update anaconda
```
To update Spyder specifically, run:
```bash
$ conda update spyder
```
