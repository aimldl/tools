Can you organize Google Photos into folders?
Make sure it's set up to sync everything in your Drive to a folder on your computer. Next, head to the Drive website, click the gear icon in the upper-right corner, select "Settings" and then check the box next to "Create a Google Photos folder." That'll put a folder with all your photos into your Drive storage.2016. 12. 9.
