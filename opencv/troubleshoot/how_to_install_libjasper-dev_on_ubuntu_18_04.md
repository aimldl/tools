# How to Install `libjasper-dev` on Ubuntu 18.04

## Problem

The following command is run as a step to install OpenCV dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt -y install libjasper-dev
```

An error occurs.

```bash
E: Unable to locate package libjasper-dev
```

## Hint

Google search: libjasper

  > libjasper-dev was available on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, so why has it been removed? Jasper was intentionally removed from Ubuntu and Debian from [this Debian bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812630).

  > Another alternative is to install libjasper-dev from an older release of Ubuntu, libjasper-dev 1.900.1 from Ubuntu Xenial 16.04. 

## Solution

The latest version at this point is 2.0.24, but I see no point of installing it. So let's just follow the instructions in the tutorial.

```bash
# Let's first install all the required build tools
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake

# Download a release and compile it.
wget https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/archive/version-2.0.16.tar.gz -O jasper-version-2.0.16.tar.gz
tar xvf cd jasper-version-2.0.16.tar.gz
cd jasper-version-2.0.16/

# Now we can start building jasper
mkdir build
export SOURCE_DIR=~/jasper-version-2.0.16
export BUILD_DIR=~/jasper-version-2.0.16/build
cd $BUILD_DIR
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -H$SOURCE_DIR -B$BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR
make clean all
make test
```
